<p class="pp_one">My dearest, I've missed you very very much since that last night we were together and will hold that night especially in my memories for years to come I've been turning it over and over in my mind lately I've read you're letter through at least 4 times and will probably read it more times before I'm through I've been sitting here looking at you're picture and getting more home sick every minute I've wanted that picture more than anything else I know of except of course you, you're self I keep thinking of you darling I keep wishing I could be home with you.</p>
<h2 class="centered">Albert</h2>
<h3 class="centered">He owns a Mac</h3>
<p class="pp_one">Albert does not like how dumb github can be. But he likes making lists.</p>
<p class="pp_one">I want to leave in the worst possible way so I could come home to see you But: Things don't look to good on that subject This war has spoiled a lot of things for everyone I guess I've never been so lonesome in my life as I am right now I'm completely lost without you darling I never realized I could miss anyone person so much I just hope it won't be too much longer till I'm able to be with you again and live a sane and normal life.</p>
